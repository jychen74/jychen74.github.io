## Jing-Yuan (Leo) Chen

I am a veterinarian and a researcher specializing in **Parrot bornavirus (PaBV)** pathogenesis, integrating **vaccine development**, **single-cell RNA sequencing**, **flow cytometry**, and **avian physiology**.  
My current research focuses on:

- Differential gene expression and pathway analysis of PaBV-4 and PaBV-5 in the nervous system
- Integration of data from QM7 cell models, _in vivo_ parrot infection models, and single-cell transcriptomics
- Standardization of bioinformatics pipelines (Seurat, Monocle3, GO/KEGG, etc.)

**Keywords:** virology, single-cell, avian biology, transcriptomics
