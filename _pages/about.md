## Jing-Yuan (Leo) Chen

I am a veterinarian and researcher specializing in viral diseases and vaccine development, with a strong commitment to advancing animal health. My early work focused on swine viral pathogens, including Porcine Circovirus Type 2 and Classical Swine Fever Virus, contributing to the improvement of diagnostic tools and disease control strategies.

In recent years, I have expanded my research to avian virology, investigating pathogens such as Avian Influenza Virus and Parrot Bornavirus. A notable achievement in this field is the development of the Instant Parrot Viral-Specific Antibody Detection Cell (ViSA), an innovative serological assay that offers rapid and reliable antibody detection for clinical applications.

My current research integrates single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the pathogenesis and host responses to Parrot Bornavirus infection in experimental parrots. This approach provides unprecedented resolution into hostâ€“pathogen interactions, enabling the identification of novel targets for intervention and informing the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.
